    <h3>Sliced</h3>
    <p class='subtitle'>An app that stores and scales recipes.</p>
    <p>I made this app as my first capstone at Thinkful because I END OF SENTENCE</p>
    <p>When a user creates a recipe on Sliced, the text is parsed to seperate the amounts and measurement units from the ingredient's name. This is displayed in the live preview at the bottom of the form.</p>
    <p>When a user clicks on a recipe in the list, they can use the slider at the top of the screen to scale the recipe up and down between 1/4 and 2 by increments of 1/4.</p>
    <p>Amounts divisible by 1/8 are converted into fractions, and other amounts are rounded to the third decimal place. Some units, including tablespoons and cups are converted into different units at appropriate breakpoints.</p>

    <h3>Spaced Repetition</h3>
    <p class='subtitle'>A language learning app that uses the spaced repetition technique to generate a series of Latin vocabulary words.</p>
    <p>The frequencey of each word is determined by it's <em>memory value</em>, which is doubled each time the word is answered correctly and reset to 1 when the word is answered incorrectly.</p>
    <p>This is implemented with the linked list data structure. The current word is always the head of the list, and words are moved back in the list based on their <em>memory value</em>.</p>
    <p>This app was build using Test Driven Development with Cypress on the front-end and Mocha, Chai, and Supertest on the back-end.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    I'm Rachel, a full-stack JavaScript developer from Chicago. A lifelong creator, my 
    background as a conceptual artist taught me to disect the work of others and to integrate what is effective to my own work. 
    My experience as a writer and a College Writing Tutuor taught the importance structure as a driving force in creative work. 
</p>
<p>
    I take all of this into my approach to coding; I strive to write code that is clear, logical, and adaptive. 
    I utilize features of contemporary JavaScript (ES6-and-newer) like destructuring and async/await because they allow me to write clearner, more precise code.
