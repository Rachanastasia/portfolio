        Sliced is an app that stores and scales recipes. This app is for people who are tired of saying, <em>Hey Siri, what is half of 1/3 cups in tablespoons?</em>
    When a user creates a recipe on Sliced, the text is parsed to separate the amount and measurement unit from the ingredient's name. 
   Users can use the slider at the top of the recipe page to scale all the ingredients up and down between 1/4 and 2 by increments of 1/4.
    Amounts divisible by 1/8 and 1/3 are converted into fractions, and other amounts are rounded to the third decimal place.
Sliced was created as my first capstone project at Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program. </p>

    <p>Spaced Repetition is a language learning app that uses the spaced repetition technique to generate a series of Latin vocabulary words.
        This app is for people who are interested in learning some Latin words. The frequency of each word is determined by its <em>memory value</em>, 
        which is doubled each time the word is answered correctly and reset to 1 when the word is answered incorrectly.
  This is implemented with the linked list data structure. The current word is always the head of the list, and words are moved back in the list based on their <em>memory value</em>.
  This project was created as my second capstone project at Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program.

        Init is a social media platform for developers to connect over their work. 
        Users can create posts, comment on posts, follow other users and view the posts of users you follow.
        This project features a paginated infinite scroll used in the profile and feed components and binary encoded images stored in the PostgreSQL database. 
        Init was created by Rachel Reilly, Adyceum Magna Ccarri, Trevor J Alt, and Steven Henderson for the final capstone at Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program.

<h2>About</h2>
<div class="about-flex-wrapper">
<div class="about-p-wrapper">
<p>
    I'm Rachel, a full-stack JavaScript developer from Chicago. A lifelong creator, my 
    background as a visual artist and writer taught me how to <em>make</em> in a way that transcends disciplines. 
    My creative work taught me to find solutions to my own problems by dissecting the work of others and adapting their solutions,
    as well as the importance of structure as a driving force in creation. 
   
</p>
<p>
    I take all of this into my approach to coding; I strive to write code that is clear, logical, and reusable. 
    I enjoy learning new things and adding new techniques to my problem-solving toolbox. 
    I write clean, well structured code with ES6-and-newer JavaScript features. 
</p>
<p>
    I am currently looking for a position as a JavaScript developer. 
    I can be reached at <em>r.a.reill18@gmail.com</em> or with the links below.
